# **1. Pendahuluan**
*It was a dark and stormy night.*

<div style="text-align: justify"> A storyteller might use these portentous words to capture your
attention and draw you into a tale. A novelist might use the same
words to begin the first page of a book. A radio play based on the
same story could open with a crash of thunder and the howling of
the wind. A film of the book could open on a scene of darkness,
suddenly illuminated by a flash of lightning that reveals trees bent
over in the gale.

Seorang pendongeng mungkin menggunakan kata-kata indah ini untuk menangkap Anda
perhatian dan menarik Anda ke dalam sebuah cerita. Seorang novelis mungkin menggunakan hal yang sama
kata-kata untuk memulai halaman pertama sebuah buku. Drama radio berdasarkan
cerita yang sama bisa dibuka dengan gemuruh guntur dan lolongan
angin. Sebuah film dari buku itu bisa terbuka di adegan kegelapan,
tiba-tiba diterangi oleh kilatan petir yang mengungkapkan pohon bengkok
di atas angin kencang.

The dark and stormy night can be represented in different media,
each of which tells the story through different means, appealing to
different senses. One of the key insights in computing is that all
these media can be represented digitally, as a structured collection
of bits, and can then be manipulated by programs on a computer,
stored on disks and other storage devices, and transmitted over
networks. Their shared digital representation means that different
media can be combined into what is loosely called multimedia.

Malam yang gelap dan penuh badai dapat direpresentasikan dalam berbagai media,
masing-masing menceritakan kisah melalui cara yang berbeda, menarik bagi
indra yang berbeda. Salah satu wawasan utama dalam komputasi adalah bahwa semua
media ini dapat direpresentasikan secara digital, sebagai kumpulan terstruktur
bit, dan kemudian dapat dimanipulasi oleh program di komputer,
disimpan di disk dan perangkat penyimpanan lainnya, dan ditransmisikan melalui
jaringan. Representasi digital bersama mereka berarti berbeda
media dapat digabungkan menjadi apa yang secara longgar disebut multimedia.

The combination of different media is not something new. On
the contrary, established forms mix media routinely. A TV news
bulletin, for example, might include sound and moving pictures
— both live and recorded — still images, such as photographs of
politicians, graphic illustrations, such as a histogram showing the
trend in unemployment, and text, in the form of subtitles, captions,
quotations, and credits, which will usually be accompanied by suitable annunciatory music. A contemporary live theatrical
performance may incorporate two- or three-dimensional artwork
and design (sets, backdrops, costumes), sound, which may be a
mixture of speech and live music, perhaps with tape recordings
and synthesized sounds, projected still and moving images, and
sometimes text in the form of surtitles (written text displayed above
the stage, which are often used for translation, especially in opera).
The integration of media is natural — we perceive the world through
all the senses we have at once; the separation of media is artificial,
and may often seem unsatisfactory.

Kombinasi media yang berbeda bukanlah sesuatu yang baru. Pada
sebaliknya, bentuk-bentuk yang mapan mencampur media secara rutin. Sebuah berita TV
buletin, misalnya, mungkin menyertakan suara dan gambar bergerak
— baik langsung maupun rekaman — gambar diam, seperti foto
politisi, ilustrasi grafis, seperti histogram yang menunjukkan
tren pengangguran, dan teks berupa subtitle, caption,
kutipan, dan kredit, yang biasanya disertai dengan musik peringatan yang sesuai. Sebuah teater live kontemporer
pertunjukan dapat menggabungkan karya seni dua atau tiga dimensi
dan desain (set, latar belakang, kostum), suara, yang mungkin berupa
campuran pidato dan musik live, mungkin dengan rekaman kaset
dan suara yang disintesis, memproyeksikan gambar diam dan bergerak, dan
terkadang teks dalam bentuk surtitles (teks tertulis ditampilkan di atas
panggung, yang sering digunakan untuk terjemahan, terutama dalam opera).
Integrasi media itu alami — kita melihat dunia melalui
semua indera yang kita miliki sekaligus; pemisahan media adalah buatan,
dan mungkin sering tampak tidak memuaskan.

Consider film, for example. From the earliest days of cinema,
in the absence of any method of recording and playing sound in
synchronization with picture, separate live sounds were produced
at the same time as the film was shown: not just the live piano
accompaniment that you may find in contemporary art-house
cinema showings of silent classics, but dialogue, singing, and sound
effects, produced by actors, singers, and noisemakers in the theatre,
often hidden behind the screen. So great was the film-going public's
desire to hear sound naturally integrated with moving pictures that
in 1927 when Al Jolson spoke his phrase, 'Wait a minute, wait a
minute. You ain't heard nothing yet,' in The Jazz Singer, audiences
stood up and cheered. It is hardly surprising, then, that once the
technical obstacles to representing media digitally (which we will
consider in Chapter 2) were overcome, the next step should be to
combine separate media. In fact, the separation of digital media into
distinct data types — different 'sorts of things' to which different
operations can be applied — can be seen as a temporary exigency
demanded by an immature technology.

Pertimbangkan film, misalnya. Dari hari-hari awal bioskop,
jika tidak ada metode untuk merekam dan memutar suara di
sinkronisasi dengan gambar, suara langsung yang terpisah dihasilkan
bersamaan dengan pemutaran film: bukan hanya piano live
iringan yang mungkin Anda temukan di rumah seni kontemporer
pertunjukan bioskop klasik bisu, tetapi dialog, nyanyian, dan suara
efek, yang diproduksi oleh aktor, penyanyi, dan pembuat kebisingan di teater,
sering tersembunyi di balik layar. Begitu hebatnya film-going public
keinginan untuk mendengar suara yang terintegrasi secara alami dengan gambar bergerak yang
pada tahun 1927 ketika Al Jolson mengucapkan kalimatnya, 'Tunggu sebentar, tunggu a
menit. Anda belum mendengar apa-apa,' di The Jazz Singer, penonton
berdiri dan bersorak. Maka, tidak mengherankan bahwa sekali
hambatan teknis untuk mewakili media secara digital (yang akan kami
pertimbangkan dalam Bab 2) diatasi, langkah selanjutnya adalah untuk
menggabungkan media yang terpisah. Bahkan, pemisahan media digital menjadi
tipe data yang berbeda — 'jenis hal' yang berbeda yang berbeda
operasi dapat diterapkan — dapat dilihat sebagai urgensi sementara
dituntut oleh teknologi yang belum matang.

# **Application of Multimedia**

# **Aplikasi Multimedia**

What is it, then, if not the combination of media, that distinguishes
digital multimedia from previous forms of combined media? It is
the fact that the bits that represent text, sound, pictures, and so on
can be treated as data by computer programs. The full potential
of this fact has not yet been fully explored, but one facet of it
immediately distinguishes digital multimedia from its predecessors.
A program can control the order in which various components
are presented and combined, and can do so in response to input from a computer user. In other words, digital multimedia can be
interactive, in a way that, for example, a TV news bulletin is not,
and that goes far beyond the simple control afforded by a VCR.

The digital multimedia version of the story we began this book with
could open with a picture depicting a dark and stormy night. By
clicking on an icon on the screen, the user could cause the scene to
play as a video clip, or add sound effects, according to their choice.
Perhaps by clicking on different areas of the scene, details could be
revealed, or a new scene could be introduced — a different one for
each part of the first scene, allowing the tangled tale of betrayal and
redemption that began on that dark stormy night to unfold in more
than one way, told through the eyes of different characters. Users
whose hearing was poor could choose to have a transcription of any
dialogue displayed for them, while users with impaired vision could
have a description of what was happening 'read' to them by their
computer. Different interface options might be offered for users
with different tastes and needs. If the story had attracted critical
attention, it might be possible to bring up learned commentaries
on particular aspects, or a history of its telling in different media.
There might be an opportunity for the user to take an active role,
change the story, add new elements or recombine the existing ones.

Suppose, though, that this is not just a story — that some crime
was committed on a real dark and stormy night, and that somebody
had subsequently been arrested and charged with an offence. By
collating evidence from witnesses, and facts about the location,
the events of the night could be reconstructed and presented, like
our story, as a mixture of animation, graphics, sound and video,
with textual annotations. Members of the jury could then examine
the event from different angles, verify that it was possible to see
something at a certain distance, perhaps factor out the parts of
the reconstruction based on a certain witness's evidence, or try out
various hypotheses suggested by the lawyers in the case. Forensic
multimedia of this sort is already being used in courts in the United
States.

Digital multimedia may be used for many things besides stories and
forensic reconstructions. The most prominent and economically
significant uses of multimedia at present are in the fields of
entertainment and education. At one extreme, the combination
of sound, animation, video and text with interactivity is commonly
found both in adventure games, such as Starship Titanic and action
games, such as Doom and its bloody offspring. At the opposite extreme are the multimedia reference works, such as the Cinemania
cinema encyclopedia, or the digital versions of the Encyclopedia
Britannica.

Multimedia is also being used educationally in schools, and for
extra-curricular and pre-school learning, where multimedia teaching
materials can be used to present information in more direct ways
than traditional books and lessons. For example, film clips and
original recordings of radio broadcasts can be integrated with a
textual account of events leading up to the Second World War
in a modern history lesson. Virtual science experiments can be
constructed using multimedia techniques, to allow pupils to work
with simulations of equipment that is not available to them. In both
these cases, interactive features allow pupils to work at their own
pace, or to pursue specialized aspects of a project according to their
particular interests. Multimedia teaching materials can be bought in
as complete CD-ROM titles, or they can be made by teachers in their
own schools. Children themselves can also make multimedia, in the
form of project reports, or as an end in itself, as an electronic class
book or newsletter.

The distinction between education and entertainment is not a clear
one; several succesful multimedia CD-ROMs use elements of games
for an educational purpose. For example, The Logical Journey of
the Zoombinis develops children's problem-solving skills through a
series of puzzles, organized in the form of a game. This approach to
learning seems to be popular for very young children, with a range
of titles available for teaching literacy and basic mathematics. These
are aimed both at schools and at parents, for use in the home. (As
a side-effect, the use of such materials also teaches computer skills
from an early age.)

In contrast to the entertainment and education sectors, where most
multimedia is professionally produced and marketed, much of the
material used in business is produced for a specific company, often
in-house. In a continuation of the use of multimedia in formal
education, multimedia materials are used for training. As with the
virtual science experiments in schools, multimedia can be used to
produce interactive simulations of equipment and procedures, in
cases where it would be expensive or hazardous to use the real thing
for training. Multimedia is also used in sales presentations and
promotions — for example, computers on sale in showrooms often
run multimedia presentations describing their capabilities, and Web
pages often function as sales brochures.

Some professions and business areas lend themselves especially
well to multimedia. Graphic designers produce interactive presentations
of their work as a supplement to, or even as a substitute
for, a conventional portfolio. The electronic portfolio can be
inexpensively duplicated on CD-ROM and sent to potential clients,
or posted on a Web site as a virtual exhibition. In the shrinkwrapped
software business, paper manuals have been gradually
giving way to electronic documentation for some years. The move
from hard copy to digital formats has provided an opportunity
to augment the text and diagrams of conventional manuals with
animations, video clips, and sound. Many programs now come with
a multimedia product tour, demonstrating their best features, and
interactive tutorials, which guide novice users through simple tasks.

One area in which computation plays a more active part is
visualization, in which graphics and animation are used as a means
of presenting complex data. Banal examples of visualizations
include pie-charts and bar-charts being generated from spreadsheet
data: their graphical form summarizes the data in a way that
makes recognition of trends and comparisons between magnitudes
possible at a glance. More complex data than the sort normally kept
in spreadsheets demands more complex visualizations to provide
the same degree of comprehensibility. Three-dimensional and timevarying
presentations, making use of false colour to carry extra
information, are often favoured. Such elaborate visualizations
are frequently generated from simulations of complex dynamic
systems: for example, a program that simulates atmospheric
dynamics may generate a time-lapse movie of the gestation of a
tropical storm; a program simulating an organic chemical reaction
may generate a three-dimensional model of the structure of the
molecules involved, showing the changes they undergo. As these
examples show, visualization is widely used by scientists; it is also
used in business, where the systems being tracked or simulated are
financial, and the output is correspondingly more abstract.

The established entertainment industry, while still delivering an
essentially linear and non-interactive product, now makes extensive
use of digital multimedia technology in the production of everything
from blockbuster movies to gardening programmes on TV. The
use of connections with digitally delivered material, such as links
between programming and supporting Web sites, or accompanying
CD-ROMs for mainstream movies, is rapidly expanding. At the
same time, a rapidly increasing number of festivals, conferences and other international events are providing showcases for "new media"
at all levels from the artistic avant garde to the purely commercial.

# **Delivery of Multimedia**

The applications we have mentioned so far are all basically concerned
with presenting material, using a combination of media,
in an interactive way. Some means of delivery is required, to get
this material from its producer to its consumers. It is useful to
distinguish between online and offline delivery.


Online delivery uses a network to send information from one
computer, often a server machine providing centralized storage of
bulky data, to another, usually a personal computer on somebody's
desk. The network in question may be a local area network serving
a single organization, but more often it will be the Internet. In
particular, the World Wide Web has established itself as a popular
means of delivering multimedia online.

        The World Wide Web has achieved such supremacy as a means of
        accessing data over the Internet that in popular perception the Web
        and the net are sometimes seen as synonymous. This is not the case,
        as we will explain in Chapter 2, and in more detail in Chapter 15.

Where multimedia is delivered offline, some removable storage
medium must be used. The widespread deployment of CD-ROM
drives in personal computers in the mid-1990s was, to some extent,
responsible for the surge in interest in multimedia at that time.
This is because, for the first time, it made available a form of
storage with adequate capacity (around 650 Mbytes, compared
to the 1.44 Mbytes of floppy disks) to accommodate the large
files characteristic of multimedia data, while still being relatively
inexpensive to duplicate. The data transfer rate of early CD-ROM
drives was too slow to support playback of video and sound, but
more recent models have increased the speed, to the point where
multimedia can be played directly from a CD-ROM, although smooth
playback of full-screen video from CD-ROM is still impossible
without additional hardware support.

While online delivery is widely seen as the future for multimedia,
the low bandwidth available for most domestic connections to the
Internet means that, especially for large and elaborate work, offline delivery on CD-ROM remains popular. There is an increasing trend
towards a combination of offline and online delivery, with CDROMs
being used to hold a fixed collection of data, augmented with
links to Web sites, where updates and supporting information are
available (sometimes for a supplementary fee).

In 1995, an industry consortium announced the specification for a
successor to CD-ROM, using the same size and shape platters, called
DVD. Originally, this stood for Digital Video Disk, since the format
was intended as a replacement for VHS cassettes as a distribution
medium for video, as analogue methods of storing video began to
be replaced by digital methods. It was immediately understood that
DVD could be used equally well for any digital data, just as the
audio Compact Disc had been adapted as the CD-ROM. Accordingly,
the name was changed, somewhat desperately, to Digital Versatile
Disk, thus keeping the abbreviation DVD. DVD offers a much higher
storage capacity (up to 17 Gbytes on a double-sided disk), with
similar transfer rates to modern (12x and higher) CD-ROM drives.
Despite considerable media enthusiasm for DVD, it has not been
taken up as rapidly as originally predicted, but during 1999, an
increasing number of personal computers were being shipped with
DVD drives fitted. Since these drives can also read CD-ROMs, it
seems likely that they will become standard peripherals, and that
DVD will be used to deliver multimedia, especially high quality
video.

Online delivery, however, offers possibilities which are not available
offline. In particular, it enables the delivery of (almost) live multimedia
content, which in turn makes possible novel applications such
as video conferencing and broadcast multimedia. Generally, when
multimedia is delivered online, the delivery need not be passive, in
the way that it is from CD-ROM: things can happen at the delivering
end; for example, a database query can be executed.

# **Historical Context**

Compared with established forms such as film or the novel,
multimedia is still in its earliest days. The CD-ROM specification
was published in 1985, with drives appearing on desktop machines
from about 1989; the World Wide Web became publicly available
outside CERN at the start of 1992, in the form of a line-based browser giving access to a handful of servers; by January 1997,
when the HTML 3.2 specification was adopted as a World Wide Web
Consortium Recommendation, audio and video were only supported
in Web pages through the use of proprietary extensions. We have
become so accustomed to the high speed of technological change in
computing that multimedia is already seen as an established feature
of the computing landscape. But, on the time-scale of cultural
change, it has barely arrived.

The history of film and animation, for example, demonstrates that it
takes time — much longer than digital multimedia has existed — for
conventions about content and consumption to become established.
The very first films exhibited to the public, by the Lumiere brothers
at the Grand Cafe on the Boulevard des Capucines, in Paris in 1895,
showed such subjects as workers going home from a factory, and
a train arriving at a station. To be able to reproduce movement
was enough, without the farrago of plot, character, or message
we normally associate with films. The early trick films of Georges
Melies were shown as part of his magic show, in the same way as the
magic lantern projections he used to create illusions. In a similar
vein, Winsor McCay's Gertie the Dinosaur, one of the first short
animations made in America (in 1909), was used as an integral part
of his vaudeville act. While Gertie did tricks, McCay stood in front
of the screen on stage and talked to her, telling her what to do, and
scolding her when she got it wrong1, in response to which Gertie
started to cry; finally McCay appeared to walk into the frame and
ride off on the dinosaur's back.

At the same time, films, including narrative and animation, were
already being shown, particularly in Europe, as entertainments in
their own right, purely to be watched on a screen. The diversity
of early ways of using film shows that there was originally no
consensus about a 'right' way to present a film. Later on, anything
other than a cinema screening would be seen as eccentric. Even
films that attempted to use the medium in original ways would
mainly do so within the cinema context, and a film shown in other
ways, for example projected onto the floor of a gallery, would be
re-defined — for example, as an 'installation'.

Another notable feature of early cinema is the way in which
established forms were translated into the new medium. In
particular, the newsreels shown around the time of the First World
War were based on the same principles as a newspaper, even to the
extent of including an animated cartoon corresponding to a comic strip. Characters were transported from the comic strips to film,
and the animators who brought them to life were often (but not
always) the artists who had drawn the strips. Perhaps more to
the point, one of the most succesful studios producing newsreels
and animations was the International Film Service, owned by the
newspaper proprietor William Randolph Hearst — who also owned
the syndication rights to many popular comic strips of the period.

Remember that the time we are now describing was twenty years
after the invention of cinema, yet we still find film looking to earlier
media for its forms and content. In a similar way, multimedia still
adopts the format of earlier media; the most obvious example is the
multimedia encyclopedia, which has the same form — a series of
short articles, accessible through one or more indexes — as its paper
equivalent, and is often published by the same organization. Other
reference works also follow the form of reference books, sometimes,
as in the case of some of Dorling-Kindersley's CD-ROMs, following
the distinctive house style of their originals. Electronic software
manuals rarely depart far from the organization of hard-copy
manuals, merely adding better searching facilities and sometimes
some animation.
